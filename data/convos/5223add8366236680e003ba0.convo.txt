When Aztlan first declared war on CalFree, I knew any association with Aztechnology would be poison, and started making plans to disassociate myself from that corporation.\n\nI do feel some regret for former colleagues who have lost their lives, but frankly, the fewer connections I have to that place, the safer I will be. But enough of that."

Millions of dead souls gathered in one place can cause some strange phenomena.\n\nIt\'s off the radar of technocratic elites like the megacorps and Saito, but don\'t get complacent down there. That place is filled with history, and history has a way of manifesting in unexpected ways."
