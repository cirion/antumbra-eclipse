Most matrix security focuses on keeping data from leaving, so I\342\200\231m going to shove as much data in there as I can. More specifically, I want to upload every detail I can about how Saito and Shavarus came close to destroying San Francisco. With any luck, that will shame the Governor into revoking his invitation, and we can properly rejoin CalFree again."
